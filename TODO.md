- [x] make it so that each ping clears the previous even if different types
- [x] add settings for different vibration patterns
  - [x] 6 interesting presets, incl shave+haircut
  - [x] totally custom
- [x] add test button to settings, that will demo the notif (and force perm req)
- [x] instead of emphasizing the purple theme, increase use of the color chosen for a given ping.  eg in the notif itself, or if possible in the underline of the focused tab in the settings.  if not possible don't worry about it
